# apt-update-all
Below is a simple script I wrote to update all the hosts in my ~/.ssh/config file and satisfy my update OCD.
I could'nt find anything similar with a quick Google search so I hope this may help someone.

Future improvements possible but don't count on regular updates. Still a few features I could implement

Note: passwords for sudo are taken from a "passwords" file in ~/.ssh
